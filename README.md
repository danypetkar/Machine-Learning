# Machine-Learning

# Definition:-
Learn from Data & Solves Problem, It is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

# Types of Machine Learning
# 1. Supervised Learning:-
Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm of inferring a function from labeled training data. The training data consists of a set of training examples.

# 2. Unsupervised Learning:-
Unsupervised learning is also a type of machine learning algorithm used to find patterns on the set of data given. In this, we donâ€™t have any dependent variable or label to predict.

# 3. Reinforcement Learning:-
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.
